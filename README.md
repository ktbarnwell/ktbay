# ktbay
your personal eBay fairy godmother

ktbay is a simple web app that I created to do automatically what I do on eBay manually, quite simply:

1. take in measurements of a favorite item of clothing of a certain category 
2. find items of that category that have similar measurements (using my veteran eBay search settings as defaults)
3. serve them up!


kt notes:

part I: 
create category pages using finding API from eBay sdk, filtering on input fields

part II:
use scraper (beautifulsoup) to dig out measurements from HTML in item description

other possibilities:
login with ebay userId and eventually add shopping mechanism
save your favorite items for easy searches
